Text Summarization (TS) is a process to generate a summary while preserving the essence, by eliminating irrelevant or redundant content from the text. TS provides vital information in a much shorter version, usually reduced to less than half of the length of the input text. It remedies the challenge of information overload  (Too much data) and helps in information retrieval (IR) tasks.


### Problem Formulation

The amount of data available online is limitless. Think about a normal college student, who has to go through thousands of pages of documents each semester. That is why text summarization is necessary.  
The main purpose of text summarization is to get the most precise and useful information from a large document and eliminate the irrelevant or less important ones. Text summarization can be done either manually, which is time-consuming, or through machine algorithms and AIs, which takes very little time and is a better option.
